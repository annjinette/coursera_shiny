## K Means Cluster Analysis with mtcars

An exploratory shiny applications was created to discover potential clusters in the mtcars dataset.  

The site allows you to choose an x variable and y variable to perform kmeans cluster analysis on. You can also choose the number of clusters you would like to calculate

## Interesting finding  

- There are a few clusters in the dataset including:   
- weight x rear axle ratio  
- horsepower x displacement  
- miles per gallon x 1/4 mile time
